# CS4131 Project: Leafer Plant Journal Application
This is an android application project made as part of CS4131 Module at NUS High School

### 1.Project Idea and Target Audience
Leafer is a plant identification-cum-journal application where users can id their plant through taking a picture. The subsequent plant is then saved/catalogued in the app where it is tracked. Users are then able to set specific reminders for each plant (i.e. watering times,....) as well as write notes about each plant.

This app is targeted towards plant enthusiasts, beginners who want to try out planting and anyone who is in need of better management for their plants.
